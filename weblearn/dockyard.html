		<h2>Dockyard Type</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>Competitive Dockyard</li>
		This dockyard's type is purposely build for competitively againts other player based on meta.The ship in dockyard only including top tier ship with top tier equipment.  
		<li>Exclusive SSR Dockyard</li>
		Anti normal,rare,and super rare ships.Because my eyes feeling pleasure if only seeing a gold color XD.
		<li>Collector's Dockyard</li>
		According to the name,doesnt matter how good or bad the ship is.Gotta Collect em all !
		<li>Meme's Dockyard</li>
		Life for the meme,sometimes there is a person that only collect loli's ship or milf's ship references to their own fetish,but as long they having fun and happy it doesn't matter. 
		</ol>

		<p>Then,you may ask <em>"Which is your type of dockyard,Wumpa ?"</em>.Well,im kind a hybrid dockyard between <b>Competitive and Collector's Dockyard</b>,in my case i love to compete againts other player and my friend to show how superior i am and other case i also love to collects cute and good looking ship even they are not in meta tier list.</p>
		<p>Taking a note,you may need collect some ship to achieve prize in achievement on main menu,also it's better to check pre-requiremennt nationality and type of ship to collect EXP for quest of prior ship you wanna to get.you better prepare those ships in your dockyard.</p>
		<table class="tableEx2">
